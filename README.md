## Introduction

This repository collects examples of training Deep Learning models on SageMaker, and demonstrates how SageMaker Debugger/Profiler
can help in model monitoring, explainability and performance optimization (taking advantage).


* `examples/1-traditional-way.ipynb` - the "traditional way" of training a model on a notebook
* `examples/2-train-job.ipynb` - the recommended way by SageMaker: launching a training job outside the notebook
* `examples/3-train-profile-debug` builds upon the previous examples and enables debugger/profiler capabilities
